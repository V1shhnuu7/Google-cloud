Google Cloud Study Jams — My Learning Journey

1.Overview

This repository documents my end-to-end journey through the Google Cloud Study Jams program, where I explore and practice various cloud technologies, APIs, data tools, and AI solutions using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Each module consists of hands-on labs and real-world scenarios designed to help learners gain practical experience with the tools used by cloud professionals every day.


2.Learning Goals

Understand the core infrastructure and services of Google Cloud

Develop and deploy applications using GCP’s compute and data tools

Gain hands-on experience with APIs, AppSheet, and Looker

Explore advanced AI and Generative AI (GenAI) solutions on Google Cloud
